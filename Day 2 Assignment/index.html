                <p id="headline">Or, a first timer’s guide to Ladakh, or as first-timers call it, Leh Ladakh</p>
                <p>Update as of March 16 2020 – In view of the current circumstances regarding COVID 2019, the district
                    administration of Leh has decided to withdraw all the Inner Line Permits (ILP) that have been
                    issued. Fresh ILPs will not be issued until further notice. We will update this post as soon as
                    there is an update regarding ILP for Ladakh.</p>
                <p class="light">Once you travel to Ladakh you know it can’t be your last trip to Ladakh – was a lesson
                    we learnt clearly on our first trip to this land of high passes (literally, the translation of
                    La-dakh). This magical remote high altitude region of the Himalayas mesmerised us with its
                    awe-inspiring barren mountains, deep blue lakes and the warmest people we have ever met.</p>
                <p class="light">So, this guide to Ladakh is for those planning their first trip to Ladakh. The guide
                    isn’t your ultimate or complete guide to Ladakh. You will find them in abundance on the internet.
                    Instead, this guide to Ladakh is based largely on our first-hand experiences in Ladakh. </p>
                <p class="heading">In this travel guide to Ladakh we answer the questions we asked on our first trip to
                    Ladakh:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Exactly where is Ladakh? Are Leh and Ladakh the same?</li>
                    <li>How to reach Ladakh?</li>
                    <li>Does Ladakh have an airport (or a railway station)? </li>
                    <li>What is the best time to travel to Ladakh? Should you visit Ladakh in winter?</li>
                    <li>What should be the budget for a trip to Ladakh?</li>
                </ul>

                    <h1>Where is Leh-Ladakh located in India?</h1>
                    <p>First things first – Leh and Ladakh are NOT synonymous to each other. Ladakh is a district in
                        Jammu and Kashmir and Leh is the district headquarters.</p>
                    <p>Ladakh is a Union territory located in North India. It is the highest plateau in India. Most of
                        Ladakh is at an altitude above 3000 meters. Surrounded by the high Himalayan mountains Ladakh
                        falls in the rain shadow region, making it a high altitude cold desert and one of the most
                        remote and sparsely populated regions of India.</p>
                    <p>It has two districts – Leh and Kargil. In this travel guide for Ladakh, we are focusing on the
                        district of Leh. The town of Leh is the district headquarters of the Leh district.</p>
                    <h3>There are some important things you need to know before you start planning your trip to Ladakh –
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Ladakh is ruled by one force, and one force only – nature. That’s the first and the most
                            important point to keep telling yourself when you plan your trip to Ladakh. </li>
                        <li>Ladakh extends far beyond Leh. Some parts of Ladakh are so remote that they are accessible
                            only by foot, a large part of it is beyond civilian access and all of it is a high altitude
                            Himalayan region. As such, even a few months at a stretch might not be enough to explore the
                            entire Ladakh region. Don’t pack too much while planning the itinerary for your trip to
                            Ladakh.</li>
                        <li>Being the district headquarters as well as the amalgamation point for all tourists visiting
                            Ladakh, Leh town has the maximum tourist facilities which come close to the material
                            comforts one is used to in cities. While enjoying these comforts, it’s important to keep
                            reminding yourselves that Ladakh is a high altitude cold desert. Natural resources, like
                            water (and air) are hard to come by. Wastage of anything here is a sacrilege.</li>

                    <h1>How to reach Ladakh? </h1>
                    <ul class="list" id="road">
                        <li>You can reach Ladakh by air or by road. Ladakh does not have a rail network so you can’t
                            reach Ladakh by train.</li>
                        <li>Reaching Ladakh by air</li>
                        <p>The airport in Ladakh is in the town of Leh. There are regular flights to Leh including
                            direct flights to cities like Srinagar, Delhi. When the weather is clear, you get some
                            spectacular views of the Himalayas on the flight to Leh. During the winter months, when the
                            high altitude mountain passes are closed, flying into Leh is the only option to reach
                            Ladakh.</p>
                        <li> The nearest railhead to Ladakh is Jammu. A railway line to Leh is an ambitious project that
                            has been announced. When done, it will be an engineering marvel. We are several years away
                            from seeing this happen. </li>
                        <li>There are 2 routes to reach Leh, Ladakh by road. </li>
                        <ol class="list">
                            <li>The Srinagar Leh highway, NH-1D</li>
                            <li>The Leh Manali highway, NH-22</li>
                        </ol>
